<h2>Demand and Supply Analytics, HKUST</h2>
<p>This course surveys supply chain management from a general manager’s perspective, emphasizing AI-native methods to 
match supply with demand. Topics include ML-driven forecasting and demand sensing; inventory, assortment, and pricing 
via reinforcement learning, bandits, and optimization; AI-augmented S&OP and scenario planning with generative models; 
logistics and network design using routing, fleet control, and digital twins; risk, resilience, and sustainability with 
anomaly detection and robust planning; and GenAI copilots for procurement, negotiations, and document understanding, 
supported by modern data infrastructure and governance. As product life cycles shrink and competition intensifies, integrating predictive models, 
optimization, and human expertise turns supply chains into a durable competitive advantage.
</p>
<h2>Engineering Foundations for Fintech, HKUST</h2>
<p>This course surveys key fintech innovations—P2P lending, crowdfunding, microloans, digital wallets 
and mobile payments, robo-advisors, and blockchain/cryptocurrencies—through the lens of engineering foundations. Students learn 
platform data structures and APIs; distributed systems and streaming for low-latency payments/trading; ML for credit scoring, 
fraud detection, and portfolio optimization; optimization for pricing and risk; cryptography and consensus for blockchains; smart contracts 
and basic formal verification; database design and ledger consistency; and security/privacy (KYC/AML, differential privacy, federated learning). 
Hands-on labs build end-to-end prototypes (lending platform, payment microservice with real-time fraud filters, robo-advisor, smart-contract token) to 
develop secure, scalable, and compliance-aware fintech systems.</p>
<h2>Operations Management, NYU</h2>
<p>This is an undergraduate core course I taught at NYU Stern as an instructor. This course covers topics such as supply chain management, inventory management, 
process analysis, basics of optimization and queueing theory, as well as revenue management.
