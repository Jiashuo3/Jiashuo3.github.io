<h2>Demand and Supply Analytics, HKUST</h2>
<p>This course surveys supply chain management from a general manager’s perspective, emphasizing AI-native methods to 
match supply with demand. Topics include ML-driven forecasting and demand sensing; inventory, assortment, and pricing 
via reinforcement learning, bandits, and optimization; AI-augmented S&OP and scenario planning with generative models; 
logistics and network design using routing, fleet control, and digital twins; risk, resilience, and sustainability with 
anomaly detection and robust planning; and GenAI copilots for procurement, negotiations, and document understanding, 
supported by modern data infrastructure and governance. As product life cycles shrink and competition intensifies, integrating predictive models, 
optimization, and human expertise turns supply chains into a durable competitive advantage.
