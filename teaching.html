<h2>Demand and Supply Analytics, HKUST</h2>
<p>This course covers major topics in supply chain management, the general process of matching supply with demand. Supply chains are networks of organizations that supply and transform materials, and distribute final products to customers. This course
views the supply chain from a general manager’s perspective. Supply and demand management represents a great challenge as well as a tremendous opportunity for most
firms. If designed and managed properly, supply chains are a crucial source of competitive advantage for both manufacturing and service enterprises. This becomes even more
important as product life cycles are shrinking, product and service variety is growing and competition is intensifying.

wallets and mobile payments, wealth management technologies such as robo-advisors,
and blockchain technologies such as cryptocurrencies</p>
<h2>Operations Management, NYU</h2>
<p>This is an undergraduate core course I taught at NYU Stern as an instructor. This course covers topics such as supply chain management, inventory management, 
process analysis, basics of optimization and queueing theory, as well as revenue management.
