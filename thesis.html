<h2>Algorithms for Online Optimization Problems in Operations </h2>
<p><i>Advisor: Prof. Jiawei Zhang &amp; Prof. Will Ma</i></p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>With the development of technologies and the booming of the online economy, it is becoming more and more important for companies to make their operational decisions in an online manner. This requires us to solve the online optimization problem where the parameters are arriving one by one, and the decisions need to be made in real-time. In this thesis, we will address the issue of how to design efficient algorithms for online optimization problems rooted from operations applications and how to obtain strong theoretical guarantees for the algorithms.</p>

<p>In the first part, we consider designing online algorithms with strong competitive ratio guarantees, which measure the relative difference of the online algorithms with respect to the offline benchmarks. Such problems are also known as prophet inequalities in the literature. we seek tight guarantees, which not only pursue the theoretical limit of the performance of any online algorithms, but also lead to new algorithms that are optimal. The key techniques root in analysis of the linear programming formulations of the online problems. The specific structures of the linear programming formulations are revealed and optimal solutions are found in closed formulations, the first time in the literature.</p>


<p>In the second part, we consider designing online algorithms with strong regret guarantees, which measure the additive difference of the online algorithms with respect to the benchmarks. Different information regimes are considered, including given or unknown distributions under a stationary or non-stationary environment. The online algorithms are developed for all these settings. The main techniques root in online convex optimization theories, online learning theories, and primal-dual analysis of the optimization problems. This thesis also discusses how the online algorithms here can be applied to solve a wide range of real-life problems arising from the operational fields, such as supply chain management, inventory management, revenue management, online advertising, and mechanism design.</p>
